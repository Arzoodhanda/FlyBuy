# FlyBuy

## Description

The goal was create a website for making shopping simple. We was finding product by search and scroll down. But In this website We will see product by our needs and direct show in front no need of search if we swipe left then our product is directly save in wishlist.
This is a fully-fledged Single page E-commerce web application using ReactJS. The application loads products from a *data.json* file and displays them.
